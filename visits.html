<p>I have been extremely fortunate to be born in this beautiful, medieval town called Arezzo, located in Toscana, Italy.
   Arezzo is about 80 kilometres southeast of Florence at an elevation of 296 metres (971 ft) above sea level.
   As of 2022, the population was about 97,000.</p>

<p>Known as the city of gold and of the high fashion,
   Arezzo was home to artists and poets such as Giorgio Vasari; <!reference from en.wikipedia.org>
   Guido of Arezzo and Guittone d'Arezzo and in its province to Renaissance artist Michelangelo.
   In the artistic field, the city is famous for the frescoes by Piero della Francesca inside the Basilica of San Francesco,
   and the crucifix by Cimabue inside the Basilica of San Domenico.
   The city is also known for the important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saracen_Joust">"Giostra del Saracino"</a>, a game of chivalry that dates back to the Middle Ages.</p>
<h3><b>Fun Fact</b></h3>
<p>The Oscar-winning film by Roberto Benigni about wartime Italy was set and filmed in filmed in Arezzo. <!-reference from en.wikipedia.org>
   Proud of the film connection, the streets of Arezzo are dotted with information boards about the film locations,
   helping film fans to identify the spot where the characters sheltered under a cushion umbrella, or cycled through the piazza.
